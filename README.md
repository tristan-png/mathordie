A fun math quiz!!! YAY!!!!

math or die (stylized as MATH/die) is a small project that i made to test linking, html and css, and page interactivity. full disclosure, this is my first ever project, so i honestly have no idea what im doing. it may look nice (hopefully), but it's definitly not the best thing you'll ever play. i still hope you enjoy it though!!!

side note - you should be in at least grade 7 to play this. the questions aren't too hard, but they may seem a bit challenging if not. :]
